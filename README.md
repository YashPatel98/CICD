# CICD

CI/CD is a means of delivering apps to clients on a regular basis by incorporating automation into the phases of app development. Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment are the three key principles associated with CI/CD. CI/CD is a solution to the issues that new code integration might bring for development and operations teams. Continuous integration practitioners merge their changes back to the main branch as frequently as possible. The changes made by the developer are validated by making a build and running automated tests against it. This avoids the integration issues that can arise when waiting until release day to integrate modifications into the release branch. Continuous integration critically on testing automation to ensure that the application is not broken when new commits are incorporated into the main branch. Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration in which all code changes are automatically deployed to a testing and/or production environment following the build step. This implies that, in addition to automated testing, you have an automatic release procedure in place and can deploy your application at any time by simply clicking a button. Next comes, Continuous deployment. Every update that makes it through all stages of your production pipeline is released to the customers using this method. There is no human intervention, and only a failing test prevents a new change from going into production. It is a wonderful technique to speed up the feedback loop with clients and relieve team pressure.

Companies can use CI/CD to ship software rapidly and efficiently. This prevailing software development approach in which incremental code updates are made on a regular and consistent basis enables a more efficient process for bringing products to market faster than ever before by continually releasing code into production and ensuring an uninterrupted flow of new features and bug fixes via the most efficient delivery method.
